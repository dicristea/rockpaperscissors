# rockpaperscissors
What I learned:
- using a branch and merging on git and github
- git pull (on accident)
- animating images and buttons using css hover pseudo class (pngs, gifs)
    - css transition-duration applied to .class, new changes on .class:hover
- text that grows/shrinks with page
- Objects and retrieving info from them
- DOM manipulation using js on events
- usage and DOM manipulation of an object array
- more practice with functions (within functions), if statements, and loops
- practiced using different types of css selectors and focused on proper id usage
- practiced more flexbox (css flexbox is weird)

Tips:
- planning out drafts of the webpage before starting to build is CRUCIAL
- using <a></a> element as a button instead of the <button></button> element
- the button can disappear by making it same color as background, images have border-radius, and on hover src changes to GIF version
- cute footer to use for now: <footer>Made by ddtea. âšœ 2022.</footer>

To do in future:
- add transition to page change after play click
- Try Again? button should be toggled on once game end
- adjust flexbox settings for wrap and mobile-friendly-ish
- Rohan's face image should shrink
